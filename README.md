# Ordering a WiFi Router via ServiceNow Service Catalog

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a practical use case of using the ServiceNow Service Catalog to streamline the process of ordering a WiFi router. The workflow includes user requests, manager approvals, and notifications, ensuring an efficient and trackable system for resolving connectivity issues.

## User Story
John, a marketing professional working remotely, experiences frequent connectivity problems due to an unreliable WiFi setup. To address this issue, John leverages the ServiceNow Service Catalog to request a new WiFi router with the following specifications:
- 2 antennas
- Approval workflow requiring manager authorization before processing

This solution highlights the integration of workflows, approval processes, and notifications to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Service Catalog Integration**: Enables users to place router requests via a standardized form.
- **Workflow Automation**: Automates the approval process, routing the request to the manager.
- **Email Notifications**: Keeps stakeholders informed of request status changes (e.g., submission, approval, and fulfillment).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Workflows**: Creating and configuring ServiceNow workflows for request approval.
- **Service Catalog**: Designing and implementing a catalog item for the WiFi router request.
- **Email Notifications**: Setting up automated email alerts for users and managers during the approval process.
